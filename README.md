# Master Thesis: Optimizing Tied-Arch Bridges for Sustainability

## Overview
This repository contains the Master's thesis by Filippo Ribes, titled "Optimizing Tied-Arch Bridges for Sustainability: A Study on Arch Size and Shape Modification". The thesis focuses on enhancing the environmental sustainability of tied-arch bridges through optimization algorithms and parametric designs to minimize steel usage, costs, and carbon dioxide emissions.

## Key Topics
- Structural design and optimization of tied-arch bridges
- Finite element modeling (FEM)
- Python development for optimization algorithms
- Comparative analysis of bridge designs
- Environmental impact assessment

## Results
The study presents an analysis of an existing tied-arch bridge made entirely of steel and explores five alternative conceptual designs with varying parameters. It demonstrates the potential for significant CO2 reduction and validates the quality of the original bridge design.

## Future Directions
The thesis concludes with suggestions for future research, including API implementation for broader application and multi-objective optimization strategies.

## How to Use
This repository includes the full thesis document, the FEM of the bridge made in Strand7 (.st7), the arch shape and size parametrization made in Excel and the Python code used for the optimization processes.
